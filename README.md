# RMIServerClient

Tested with python 2.7

If you're running this on a debian distro you can just run:

```
$ ./dependencies.sh
```

It should install all necessary dependencies to run. After that, you should run pyro4-ns.

```
$ pyro4-ns
```

Server:

```
$ python server.py
```

Client:

```
$ python client.py
```
